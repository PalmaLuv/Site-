This is my portfolio in the form of a website for convenient viewing of information about me and my skill sets.  

## Individual approach

The site has a customized design for easy user perception. We created a switch between the light and dark theme of the site. Also, a separate page has been developed where all the projects I have ever worked on or am currently working on are located (in some cases there is **source code**).
